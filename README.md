# mosaic-builder
This was a little project I did for my work colleagues on a farewell. We got a beautiful background and pasted lots of pictures of us on this background and got a nice result.

The added value is the time you save from putting one by one in photoshop or any other editor.

The code still need some improvement if we want to do more sophisticated pictures, but it does the job.
